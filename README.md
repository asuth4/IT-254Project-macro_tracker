# IT-254Project-macro_tracker
The goal of this project is to create a fast and easy way to check the nutrition information of foods using machine learning.  We plan to use chat-GPT's API tokens to allow prompting within our program.  Paired with Arduino, this program will read out the nutrition to the user.  Hardware: arduino board, laptop with camera, speaker attachment.
For our food identification model we used: google/vit-base-patch16-224
